# create-r1-app

The fastest way to start a React project using Vite, TypeScript, ESLint & TailwindCSS.

On running the NPX command, this node project generates a React-TypeScript project using Vite. Futhermore, it installs TailwindCSS and configures ESLint (with Airbnb rules(and some of mine)). It saves a lot of time and effort.

## How To Run

```
npx create-r1-app my-app
```

```
cd my-app
```

```
npm run dev
```
